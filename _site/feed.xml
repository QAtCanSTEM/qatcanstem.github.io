&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-yourself&quot;&gt;Tell Us about yourself:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a master’s student in the Department of Oceanography at Dalhousie University. My interests outside of research include biking, hiking, arts and crafts, and 90s pop divas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-your-work&quot;&gt;Tell us about your work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish farms have been proposed as an alternative to commercial fishing to supply protein for the world’s population. My work looks at the environmental impacts of wastes from these farms in coastal settings. Specifically, how far they spread, how long they persist in the marine environment, and what are the most effective indicators for tracking these wastes. My research is supported by a Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship and an NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-your-work-informed-by-your-identity-as-an-lgbtq-person&quot;&gt;How is your work informed by your identity as an LGBTQ+ person?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to tease apart different aspects of your personality and attribute behaviors to one specific trait. Broadly, being gay has affected how I function, both good and bad. I was born and raised in a conservative small town in BC, which in many ways was an amazing place to grow up. However, it was quite close-minded towards sexuality and gender expression. To get through, I learned to block out these criticisms and ultimately this became a skill that has made me a better researcher and academic. I became focused, driven, and good at short- and long-term goal setting. This has also made me more guarded as a person. Not caring what people think brings its own challenges including a sense of disconnection and disengagement. Throughout my life I have fluctuated between these two extremes of caring too much about what people think to caring too little. Many LGBTQ+ people have to navigate this balance on their own in their childhood and often into adulthood. Science requires both collaborative and independent work, and things like your interests, working style, and how you interact with others are all shaped by your background. It is exciting to see platforms such as QAtCanSTEM which brings together a community of LGBTQ+ researchers with shared experiences and sense of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-are-your-lgbtq-role-models&quot;&gt;Who are your LGBTQ+ role models?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t say I have any specific LGBTQ+ role models that I try to emulate directly. I think with each LGBTQ+ individual I meet, I gain a sense of reassurance and validation, and they are a collective source of inspiration that I draw from at different times in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5---10-years&quot;&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 - 10 years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I find it hard to plan 5-10 days into the future, let alone 5-10 years. I don’t have any specific goals set in stone and like everyone, I am finding it difficult to navigate the uncertainties of this new COVID world. A vague but stable goal is that I end up in a career that challenges and values me. I would also love to have a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-would-you-like-to-change-about-academia-or-equivalent-to-make-it-more-welcoming-to-lgbtq-folks&quot;&gt;What would you like to change about Academia (or equivalent) to make it more welcoming to LGBTQ+ folks?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there needs to be a readjustment and rebalance of bottom-up and top-down EDI initiatives in STEM. There is often an intense focus on the recruitment of undergrads, but typically, the larger issue is the promotion and retention of minority individuals within the higher levels of academia. I think it is slowly changing, but survivorship bias is real, and we need to listen and acknowledge why many choose to leave. From my own experience, I entered my undergrad with a general interest in science, but no particular draw to one field over another. Over time I noticed there were subdisciplines that were less welcoming that I gradually steered away from. I worry there has been an enormous loss of talent where people have realized they can have equally fulfilling careers completely outside of STEM without this (real or perceived) hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;any-other-comments&quot;&gt;Any other comments?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found there is an entrenched view that STEM is a meritocracy, where sexuality and gender expression do not and should not matter. As a result, people are generally very quiet about these issues. I have been in many environments where my sexuality is embraced and has truly been a non-issue. Other times, people say they are okay with it but are clearly uncomfortable around even the slightest sense of flamboyance. A lot of work still needs to be done where we move from learning to say the right things to actually addressing these internalized biases. Also, many LGBTQ+ people still carry a large amount of shame which requires time and attention to work through. I hope we address these problems externally and internally to avoid burnout and have rewarding careers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary type="html">I am more passionate about and am more fulfilled by my work when I am comfortable and secure in my work environment, and strive to help build and maintain work environments that help people feel the same way.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Atlantic Canadian STEMist - Tam Pham</title><link href="https://qatcanstem.github.io/TamPham/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Atlantic Canadian STEMist - Tam Pham" /><published>2020-06-22T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2020-06-22T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>https://qatcanstem.github.io/TamPham</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://qatcanstem.github.io/TamPham/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Profiles/TP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-yourself&quot;&gt;Tell Us about yourself:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a M.Sc student at the Rainey lab from Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University. My research interest is centered around understanding protein structure-function correlation using a biophysical technique called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Because of my unique identity as an immigrant QTBIPOC individual, I come to realize the lack of representations in the Atlantic Canada academic settings, STEM field and throughout my life. I encountered QTBIPOC folks who felt that they were “left out” from the conversation when it comes to 2SLGBTQ+ issues whether personal or professional environment. It motivates me to become more involved with 2SLGBTQ+ advocacy whether in my personal free time with the Nova Scotia Rainbow Action Project (NSRAP) or in the STEM field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-your-work&quot;&gt;Tell us about your work:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I study about the apelinergic system in humans. This system has many therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and cancer. The system comprises of the apelin receptor, apelin and apela isoforms. My research interest focuses on the interaction between two known apelin isoforms (apelin-55 and apelin-36) with the apelin receptor using a variety of NMR techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-are-your-lgbtq-role-models&quot;&gt;Who are your LGBTQ+ role models?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Takei has always been one of the few BIPOC LGBTQ+ celebrities who uses his platform to promote spreading love and acceptance towards and within the 2SLGBTQ+ communities. I stand for his motto and strive to be like him one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5---10-years&quot;&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 - 10 years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 5 – 10 years from now, I envision myself as someone who can actively do research and mentor the upcoming generation of scientists. As someone working towards more inclusivity and acceptance for communities, I would still continue to advocate and be the voice for the visible minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I would like to change about the current educational system is reducing the promotions of hate speech such as xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, etc… I encountered occasions where people with high positions in the academia utilizing their position to spread their hatred to others. In my humble opinions, as someone who happens to exist in the intersectionality of multiple marginalized identities, I do not want the existence of hate speech to discourage folks from their aspirations and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary type="html">As someone who happens to exist in the intersectionality of multiple marginalized identities, I do not want the existence of hate speech to discourage folks from their aspirations and dreams.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Queer Atlantic Canadian STEMist - Rachel Clarke</title><link href="https://qatcanstem.github.io/RachelClarke/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Queer Atlantic Canadian STEMist - Rachel Clarke" /><published>2019-09-05T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2019-09-05T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>https://qatcanstem.github.io/RachelClarke</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://qatcanstem.github.io/RachelClarke/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Profiles/RC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-yourself&quot;&gt;Tell Us about yourself:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I study at Acadia University, I’m also queer and bisexual. I am an eclectic environmentalist, a novice knitter, a devoted cat-Mom, and an avid podcast listener. Aside from my research, I am interested in science communication and LGBTQ+, mental health stigma, and feminist issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-your-work&quot;&gt;Tell us about your work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury, a neurotoxic and endocrine-disrupting chemical, can be removed naturally from water through a chemical reaction called photoreduction, which is facilitated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. My research project aims to get a better idea of how salinity and dissolved organic matter concentration influence these chemical reactions in estuaries. Understanding these factors can help us better predict mercury retention in these environments. My research is supported by the Arthur Irving Graduate Scholarship in Environmental Studies and an NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-your-work-informed-by-your-identity-as-an-lgbtq-person&quot;&gt;How is your work informed by your identity as an LGBTQ+ person?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My identity as an aspiring scientist and my sexual identity are two very large parts of who I am. As someone who identifies as bisexual, being comfortable and secure in myself has been very important to me. I am more passionate about and am more fulfilled by my work when I am comfortable and secure in my work environment, and strive to help build and maintain work environments that help people feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-are-your-lgbtq-role-models&quot;&gt;Who are your LGBTQ+ role models?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing, considered by many to be the father of theoretical computer science, wasn’t given the credit he deserved because he was gay, and ultimately died by suicide at 41 years old. He made a very large contribution to the World War II effort and modern technology, and his loss is an example of the collective loss of potential knowledge from members of the LGBTQ+ community who are discouraged from pursuing science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QAtCanSTEM’s own founder Landon Getz has also become a role model of mine. I admire his passion for LGBTQ+ advocacy and community building, and I’m very excited to see what QAtCanSTEM becomes with his leadership!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5---10-years&quot;&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 - 10 years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not yet decided what career route I want to pursue after my Master’s degree. I have been exploring many options that could lead me down many different roads, but the only thing I see clearly 5 - 10 years in the future is being involved in science. 
In short, I hope to still be happy and fulfilled with the work I’m doing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-would-you-like-to-change-about-academia-or-equivalent-to-make-it-more-welcoming-to-lgbtq-folks&quot;&gt;What would you like to change about Academia (or equivalent) to make it more welcoming to LGBTQ+ folks?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling like you have to hide who you are as LGBTQ+ to succeed is incredibly disheartening and stifling. Having to be two different people on a daily basis is exhausting, and in general I think our work environments should strive to foster acceptance and diversity. Everyone should be able to be who they are without fear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;any-other-comments&quot;&gt;Any other comments?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can attend QAtCanSTEM, I look forward to meeting you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary type="html">I am more passionate about and am more fulfilled by my work when I am comfortable and secure in my work environment, and strive to help build and maintain work environments that help people feel the same way.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Queer Atlantic Canadian STEMist - Landon J.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-yourself&quot;&gt;Tell Us about yourself:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Queer and Gay PhD Student studying at Dalhousie University. I am an LGBTQ+ Advocate and an amateur home bread baker. I am interested in ethics in science and the relationship between science and society. I am an enthusiastic Cat-Dad to a target tabby named Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-us-about-your-work&quot;&gt;Tell us about your work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am studying an ocean an ocean bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&lt;/em&gt; (and bacteria related to it) to get a better idea of how they metabolize carbon in the environment. These organisms grow better at warmer temperatures and lower salinity, so as the ocean warms through climate change, we can expect to see more Vibrio around. We are primarily concerned with what that might mean, and are doing important research to identify how they might respond to climate change. My work is support by a Killam Predoctoral Scholarship and a Vanier Canadian Graduate Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-your-work-informed-by-your-identity-as-an-lgbtq-person&quot;&gt;How is your work informed by your identity as an LGBTQ+ person?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My identity as a gay man is an integral part of who I am, and therefore informs pretty much everything I do. Most importantly, being comfortable with my own identity has allowed me to ensure that the spaces that I create (be that a laboratory, classroom, community, etc) is a space that is open and welcoming to all. I have made it my mission to ensure that LGBTQ+ folks are always welcome in the spaces that I occupy.
As the founder of QAtCanSTEM, I am trying to build a community for LGBTQ+ STEM folks in Atlantic Canada to find role models and a community. I wanted my profile to be first so that I can make the first step and hold out my hand for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-are-your-lgbtq-role-models&quot;&gt;Who are your LGBTQ+ role models?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alex Bond, the senior curator in charge of birds at the Natural History Museum, encouraged me to attend (and hosted me) the LGBTSTEMinar in 2019 in London, UK. Attending this event gave me the motivation to launch QAtCanSTEM and the QAtCanSTEM Colloquium, and I can’t thank him enough for everything he’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5---10-years&quot;&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 - 10 years?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My immediate goal is to stay in academia and some day (maybe in 10 years?) have my own lab. I am well-aware of the availability of academic jobs however, and have kept doors open in biotechnology and ethics in science. I don’t know what i’ll be doing in 10 years, but i’m excited to find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-would-you-like-to-change-about-academia-or-equivalent-to-make-it-more-welcoming-to-lgbtq-folks&quot;&gt;What would you like to change about Academia (or equivalent) to make it more welcoming to LGBTQ+ folks?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could change something about our environments to make it more welcoming to LGBTQ+ folks, I would make it so everyone knows why it’s so important for me to be able to be gay in the workplace. For me it’s about being able to be myself (and be comfortable with it) in every environment I find myself in. For me, it’s about being able to express myself so I can do my best work. It’s for this reason that I will keep working for the inclusion of everyone in STEM, including LGBTQ+ folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;any-other-comments&quot;&gt;Any other comments?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage any other Atlantic Canadians, or former Atlantic Canadians, to fill out the profile submission form and join our ranks.
