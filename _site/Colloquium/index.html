    <h1>Keynote Speakers:</h1>
    <img src="/assets/images/alex.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" style="position: center;" />
    <h2><a href="https://alexanderbond.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Alexander Bond</a>, Senior Curator in Charge of Birds, Natural History Museum</h2>
    <h3>Hidden Diversity in Science: Queer in STEM</h3>
<p><b>Abstract</b>: The experiences of LGBTQ+ people in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are not always positive, and the result of a combination of societal influences, and discipline-specific biases. Growing up in New Brunswick, I saw my professional and personal identities as separate, and it has only been recently when I’ve been able to reconcile these two aspects. This has been in large part thanks to organizations like LGBTQ+ STEM, and the community around it in the UK. I will give a brief history, both personally and of LGBTQ+ rights in the UK, and discuss the parallels between how we perpetuate, perceive, and experience harm as a community, and our research on marine plastic pollution as an example of queering science.</p>
<p><b>Biography</b>: Dr Alex Bond (he/him) is the Senior Curator in Charge of Birds at the Natural History Museum, and an Adjunct Researcher at the University of Tasmania, where he studies conservation biology of seabirds and islands, particularly plastic pollution and other contaminants. He grew up in Nova Scotia, Labrador, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland before moving to the UK in 2014 with his husband Jeremy. For the last 5 years, he has helped run LGBTQ+ STEM, an organization for the promotion of LGBTQ+ workers, researchers, and students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including through the annual LGBTQ+ STEMinar, a one-day research symposium that now attracts hundreds of attendees.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.upei.ca/profile/nola-etkin" target="_blank">Dr. Nola Etkin</a>, Interim Dean of Science, University of Prince Edward Island</h2>
    <h3>A Queer Activist in the Academy: My Journey as an Out Lesbian Student and Faculty Member</h3>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>: While there are decades of data and discussions surrounding women and other under-represented groups in science and engineering, it is only very recently that the conversation has been broadened to focus on the experiences of those among us who are not cis-gender and heterosexual – those whose voices have been silenced by fear and stigma, and the perception that our identities are “personal” and have no relevance to our science, and no place in our classrooms.</p>
    <p>In this presentation I will share my experiences as an out, lesbian PhD student and faculty member, navigating the pathway to and through an academic career.  My story will show how, for me, the personal is not only political, it is so entwined with the professional that I cannot tell the story of my journey as a student and an academic without telling the story of my personal journey and of my activist self.  I will share how I was able to bring my activism into my academic life, and in the process change the entire direction of my career.</p>
    <p><b>Biography</b>: Dr. Nola Etkin is a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Prince Edward Island, where she has taught Organic Chemistry and conducted research in Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis since 1997. She served for six years as Chair of the Department of Chemistry, and in 2019 she was appointed interim Dean of Science at UPEI. Throughout her career, Nola has been a leader and an equity activist, both within academia and in her community. Her involvement in Equity work began as a PhD student at the University of Alberta where she was involved in the local Women in Science and Engineering group and co-chaired the campus GLBTQ group. In the late 1990's she was part of a small group that lobbied the PEI government for the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Human Rights Act, and was a founding co-chair of Abegweit Rainbow Collective, which was formed to provide support and advocacy to PEI’s 2SLGBTQ community. She is currently Chair of the Board of PEERS Alliance (formerly AIDS PEI) and serves on the Canadian Society for Chemistry (CSC) Working Group on Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, and the CSC Board as Director of Student Engagement. In 2016 Nola edited the book “Making Chemistry Inclusive: Proceedings of the CSC Symposium on Equity and Diversity in Chemistry.”
